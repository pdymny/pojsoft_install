# If you just need a quick backend for your Symfony application, this is the
# only configuration you must define in this file:
#
easy_admin:
  formats:
    date:     'd-m-Y'
    time:     'H:i'
    datetime: 'd-m-Y H:i:s'
#  entities:
#         - AppBundle\Entity\Category
#         - AppBundle\Entity\Product
#         - AppBundle\Entity\Purchase
#         - AppBundle\Entity\PurchaseItem
#        - App\Entity\User
#        - App\Entity\UserNotify
#
# In this demo application, the configuration is split into several small files
# to show an alternative way to define the configuration for complex backends.
#
# The configuration options are explained in detail in the bundle documentation,
# which is published at https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/index.html
#
imports:
    - { resource: easy_admin/ }
